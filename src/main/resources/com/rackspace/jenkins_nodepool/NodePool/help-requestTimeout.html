	Timeout in seconds for nodepool to fulfil a node request.
	If nodepool doesn't have any ready nodes, it will have to create a new
	instance to fulfil the request, so this should be at least long enough

	is at quota, and no nodes are released while the request is waiting,
	the request will be marked as failed after this amount of time.
